As our backend developer, I coded the logic for multiple different user input types in python. I created a dictionary which will store various variables such as the randomly generated session ID, the actual word, the defenition, and all of the user’s guesses. This makes it very easy to use if statements and verify if the user’s guess is in the word or not."

Each packet also includes the source and the destination information.\nThe message (file) is broken up into packets and sent in any order. The packets are reassembled by the recipient’s device. (Packet Switching)\n\n\n\nThe Internet\n\nThe Internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open (nonpropritary) communication protocols.\nAccess to the Internet depends on the ability to connact a computing dvice to an internet connected device.\nRouting on the Internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance\nInformation is passed through the Internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets\nPackets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the Internet, as well as for data reassembly\nPackets may arrive at the destination in order, our of order, or not at all\nThe World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files\nThe World Wide Web uses the Internet\n\n\n\nProtocols\n\nA protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system.\nThe protocols used in the Internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the Internet.\nIP, TCP, and UDP are common protocols used on the Internet\nTCP does error checking and error recovery so it is slower\nUDP performs error checking, but it discards erroneous packets\nHTTP is a protocol used by the World Wide Web\n\n\n\nInternet and Transport Layers\n\nTransport Layer - How the packets are sent, and for what\nReliability - reliable - sender gets a receipt back, resend as needed TCP\nUnreliability - send and forget. UDP\n\n\n\nInternet Layer\n\nIPv4: Example 192.168.24.1 32 bits, separated into 4 “octets” 8 bits long (0-255)\nSeparated into 2 parts:\nNetwork (1-31)\nDevice (32-network bits)\nThree targets that can be addressed using IP\nUnicast - A specific device.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Common Errors:\nTo start, it’s important to note that no one is perfect. Errors are bound to happen but identifying, understanding, and fixing thoses errors is what matters more. There are 4 main types of errors when developing a program; Logic, Syntax, Run-time, and Overflow errors.\n\nLogic errors are errors that are caused due to the programmer making a mistake in the algorithm. This causes the program to behave unexpectedly. A logic error can result in events in the program taking place in times that they are not suppose to happen in.\nSyntax errors are very small mistakes made by the programmer that doesn’t match with the language. It could be a typo, unnecessary code, missing necessary code, missing characters or added characters. Characters include colon, semicolon, parenthesis, indentations, quotes, and so much more. These mistakes will cause the program to shut down.\nRun-time errors happen when a program stops while it is running. This event is also known as “crashing” and the error is normally referred to as a “bug”. A run-time error can be caused by dividing by zero, wrong inputed data type, or many other errors that are commonly caused by incorrect data.\nOver-flow errors occur in a program when it is required to perform a calculation that is not possible for it to run. The values in the calculations are outside the set range of values of the program. This is caused due to memory allocation constraints of the program’s language, resulting in restrictions.\n\n\n\nMethods to Correct Errors:\n\nIDEs: Syntax errors are the easiest errors to fix because most IDEs display information on where and when there is a syntax error.\nTest Cases: Unlike syntax errors, logic errors are more difficult to found because the IDEs doesn’t help you and it would normally look like nothing is wrong. This is when programmers use test cases. Test cases are a set of actions(like inputs) that are used to check if they get the correct result.\nHand Tracing: Another testing strategy is hand tracing. Hand tracing is putting in values of variables in a loop to find out if the outcome is correct. This is most useful with loops and other small code segments that repeat a number of times.\nExtra Outputs: Lastly, a programmer could just add extra outputs. This strategy is used so that the programmer could find where the error is in the program. When the error is fixed, the extra output is normally removed."

    "text": "Video Notes\nComputer programs accept input in a variety of different forms (tacile aka touch, audio, visual, text). Programs are mostly event-driven –> events (mouse clicks, screen taps/swipes, physical button clicks, eyboard entries, audio keywords/phrases) are triggered by actions, which sends input to the program. Input affects output of a program. Outputs can be visual, audio,touch/feel(vibrations), text, etc. A program (aka software) is a collection of statements. A statement is a single command, a group of statements is a code segment. To describe a code segment, first state what it does, and then include how it does it.\n\n\nHacks\nMy group’s final project idea is to create a hangman version flash cards to help us study with various vocab/questions. The flash cards will be in the format where it asks you a question and you will have a textbox to input your answer. Then it will show you the actual answer of the question and you can compare your questions. This will make studying more fun as it’t flash cards but in a game format.\n\nIt is for an educational purpose because it’ll help us develop our coding vocabulary. The project is able to be expanded and thus will hold our interest for 8 weeks because we can add additional features such as ways to test your knowledge.\nThis project does have the potential for someone to use it beyond the 8 weeks because it helps with studying which is very important to people’s lives.\nThis project does have potential for the Create Performance Task submission:\nThe purpose of the program is to provide a platform in which users can study for a subject.\nInformation such as the questions and answers will be stored in lists, which demonstrates data abstraction.\nThe list will have to contain the items to display.\nThe procedures will involve creating questions and answers for those questions.\nRandomizing questions will require an algorithmn.\nThere can be functions such as “quizes” that need to call different values from different places."

With that being said, I did have problems while using an if/else block. My original plan was to make an if else loop for each question. So if the correct answer was chosen, it would move you to the next question. Else, it would take you to the incorrect answer screen. However, using the if blocks was quite difficult and it didn’t let me customize the if statement as much as I wanted. So I was forced to use on-event blocks for each and every answer option. This made it harder to code my quiz, and due to this my code is much less efficient.\n\n\nWays I could further improve my quiz\nThe first thing I would do is add some more questions. Next I would randomize the order of the questions to make the quiz harder. I also plan to add more gifs and sound effects for every correct answer. Another big thing that I wanted to change was that On the final screen, I wanted to change the “Epic victory royale” title based on the score, because right now, even if you get 0 answers correct, it still says “Epic victory royale”. And lastly, I was also thinking of storing everyones name and score in a dictionary, so I could display a leaderboard for who has the most correct answers."

Hence, I was really impressed by the quality of drawings these kids had made. Some of them looked so realistic it just blew my mind.\n\n\n\nCeramics\nHere are some pictures of artworks in Ceramics.  \nI’m not very familiar with how ceramics works, so it was really cool to see how students were able to create such unique shapes and also make them shiny."

These small errors include an incorrect usage of syntax, a typo, or a missed character. Most errors are like this but sometimes the error is bigger. Entire procedures can have the wrong purpose, code is typed using an incorrect language, program is set up incorrectly, and code could be blocked to some members of the team. All of these errors can break the entire code so all errors have to be fixed before we push our code.\n\nWhat are some test cases that can be used?\n\nProper inputs for our team’s program would be english words but we would have to test more than just that. Test cases that can be used would include any word from any language with any amount of letters as well as numbers or other special characters. This would mostly likely break the code and that is why my group must test them. It would be the best way to fix them, as we can debug and fgure out how to not let this break the code."

    "text": "Questions\nA lot of the questions consisted of those on collaboration and its benefits. It also asked questions about the Internet, such as protocols and data transmissions. There were also many questions that gave a block of code and asked for the result or an error in the code. A few problems even described programs and asked potential errors, inputs, outputs, and uses. Some questions asked about coding and data types, such as lists, strings, and variables. There were also some questions on binary numbers, algorithms, indexes, sequences, and results of code. Most of these questions were fairly straightforward, but some of them were misleading, and required a lot of thinking.\n\n\nWhat I missed\nI missed 7 questions. Most of these were due to silly mistakes. For example, the question asked to choose 2 answers but I only chose 1. I also missed 1 or 2 questions because I forgot some information about the Internet, protocols, and binary coding. Some problems that included code were also very confusing, often interchanging the values of variables constantly, and then asking for the output.\nQuestion #16: I put that “The message is broken into packets that are transmitted in a specified order. Each packet must be received in the order it was sent for the message to be correctly reassembled by the recipient’s device.” The correct answer was “The message is broken into packets. The packets can be received in any order and still be reassembled by the recipient’s device.”. This is because Messages are broken into packets. Each packet contains data to be transmitted, as well as metadata for routing and reassembling the data upon receipt. This allows the packets to be received in any order and still be reassembled correctly.\nQuestion #17: I put that “Open protocols allow devices to specify how data packets are to be routed on the Internet in advance.” The correct answer was “Open protocols provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices.” Protocols are agreed-upon sets of rules that specify the behavior of a system. Protocols used on the Internet enable devices from different manufacturers to communicate in a standard way.\nQuestion #31: I thought that the answer would be f, but it would actually be h. This is because the character “f” is the character at index 3 of the string element at index 2 in wordList.\nQuestion #32: I thought the contents would be [10, 30, 50, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80]. The actual contents would be [10, 30, 50, 70]. This is because The last assignment statement assigns a copy of myList to yourList. Since myList contains [10, 30, 50, 70], yourList will also contain [10, 30, 50, 70].\nQuestion #33: I thought that 1, 3 and 5 would be displayed. It would actually be 100 300 500. This is because the code segment traverses the list from left to right and displays each value that is greater than or equal to 90.\nQuestion #35: I confused this one a bit. The last line in this code segment would be set maxPS to 50 regardless of the value of time.\nQuestion #48: I thought that all x, y and z will be displayed but the correct answer is just x and z. This is because the first three statements assign values to the variables. The fourth statement assigns the value of y (which is 50) to x. The fifth statement assigns the value of z (which is 75) to y. The sixth statement assigns the value of x (which is 50) to z. Therefore, x and z both have the value 50.\n\n\nWhat I can do better\nNext time, I will make sure to read the problem carefully, and figure out exactly what it is asking. I can also look at the block of code, if given, more carefully, and comprehend what it is doing. I also have to remember to study some of the AP CSP materials, mainly those about the Internet, including protocols, and binary coding. I also have to study data trannsmissions and algorithms."
